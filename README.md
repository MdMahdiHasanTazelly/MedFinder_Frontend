# MedFinder
It's an integrated platform for finding doctors and hospitals infromation. As a course project of Junior Design, I and Mahmudul Hasan Ashik have built this project. 
There are 2 views.
- User
- Admin </br>

### Features
- User can only see the informations.
- The admin can add, delete, update the hospitals and doctors informations. However, no one can be an admin randomly. Technical team
will assign someone as admin.
- A named based searching is implemented for both doctor and hospital. User can see doctors or hopitals info related to the given search query.
- Doctors chamber information canbe seen as well. If any hopital is not affiliated with this application, the hospitals can't be added as doctors chamber.
